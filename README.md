# Spotify Clone | Front-End Project
A responsive Spotify-inspired web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project replicates the core UI/UX of Spotify, including a music player interface, playlist layout, and smooth animations. Designed to enhance my front-end development skills and explore media-focused web design.
